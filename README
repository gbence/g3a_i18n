= G3A::I18n

== Summary

This is an extension to the original Ruby/Rails I18n project, that should be
found in activesupport's vendor directory.  G3A::I18n gives you the ability to
localize Integers and Floats numbers through the well known I18n API, eg.:

    require 'g3a/i18n'
    I18n.locale = :hu
    I18n.l 1234
    # => "ezerkétszázharmincnégy"
    I18n.l(1234.0 + 1/6.0)
    # => "ezerkétszázharmincnégy és egy hatod"
